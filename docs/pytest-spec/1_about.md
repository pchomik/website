# About

**pytest-spec** is a powerful pytest plugin that transforms your test execution output into a clean, readable specification format. Whether you're writing unit tests, integration tests, or behavior-driven development tests, pytest-spec helps you present your test results in a way that's both informative and professional.

## Why pytest-spec?

Traditional pytest output can be difficult to read and understand, especially when dealing with large test suites. pytest-spec addresses this by:

-   **Improving readability** with structured, specification-style output
-   **Enhancing maintainability** by clearly organizing test results
-   **Providing visual clarity** with color-coded status indicators
-   **Supporting modern testing patterns** like describe blocks and class-based tests

## Key Features

### 🎨 Beautiful Output Formatting

-   Transforms standard pytest output into a clean specification format
-   Color-coded results (✅ passed, ❌ failed, ⏭️ skipped)
-   Clean, professional presentation that's easy to scan

### 🔧 Flexible Test Naming

-   **Automatic cleanup**: Removes `test_` prefix and underscores from test names
-   **Docstring support**: Use docstring summaries instead of function names for more descriptive output
-   **Customizable formatting**: Adapt the output to match your team's conventions

### 🧪 Comprehensive Test Support

-   **Function-based tests**: Full support for traditional pytest test functions
-   **Class-based tests**: Proper handling of pytest class-based test structures
-   **Describe-style tests**: Supports BDD-style testing with describe blocks
-   **Mixed test suites**: Works seamlessly with different testing patterns in the same suite

### 🎯 Enhanced Readability

-   **Human-friendly names**: Transforms technical test names into readable specifications
-   **Clear status indicators**: Instant visual feedback on test results
-   **Concise output**: Focuses on what matters without unnecessary technical details

## Perfect For

-   **Development teams** who want clearer test result reporting
-   **Code reviewers** who need to quickly understand test coverage
-   **Documentation** teams that want to include test specifications
-   **CI/CD pipelines** that require readable test output
